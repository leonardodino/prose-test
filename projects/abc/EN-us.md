  This project fosters food production with ingredients that are naturally found
  in the Cerrado (the Brazilian savannah), and merges various experiences to
  revise traditional recipes passed on from generation to generation. What's
  created is the socioeconomic development of local communities through the
  sustainable use of natural resources.

The story began in 2004 when a group of women met to merge their varied life
experiences in the Cerrado with their expertise on the traditional food from the
region, generally passed down from generation to generation. An informal group
was formed, and today includes 21 local projects from more than 8 states in the
region that focus on developing 25 value chains pertaining to extractivism, agricultural
extractivism and traditional family farming, including the Babassu palm production
chain.

'Through the use of culinary recipes, products with an economic and social
origin are created based on native ingredients: pulps, creams, oils, pâtés, sauces,
nuts and, especially, bakery products. This format encourages the environmental
preservation of the region, an area that boasts the second largest biome in South
America and renowned as the richest savannah in the world. The project empowers
the local community and encourages the sustainable use of natural resources, as
well as preserving history through cuisine. Moeda provides working capital to
improve and develop the products, assists in acquiring materials and supplies,
gives technical training to workers and streamlines production.'
